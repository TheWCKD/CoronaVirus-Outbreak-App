I opened this repository so that you can <li> download and install the latest official update of the application </li> <li> submit issues/features [on my Discord Server (recommended)](https://discord.gg/jwjqHYs) or [on this Github repo](https://github.com/TheWCKD/CoronaVirus-Outbreak-App/issues)</li>

<h2> Latest Update - 1.1.0 - (13th of March 2020)</h2>

- <b> [Download from MEGA.NZ (v1.1.0)](https://mega.nz/#F!0dAG0IyQ!chRRyRGJryiCEIpfK1wVgA) </b>

<i>Note: For those of you who know what the instruction sets of your device's CPU is (arm64, armeabi, x86_64), you can check out the specific app files [here](https://mega.nz/#F!RBgnRS7Z!ykNrwvgk2wvb51IbE6YRPw). For those of you who read this and wanna know how to find your device's CPU instruction set, [read this article](https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/android-basics-see-what-kind-processor-you-have-arm-arm64-x86-0168051/).</i>

<h2> Instalation </h2>

1. Download the latest update from one of the links above.
2. You will end up with an .apk file which you'll have to tap in order to install it.
3. Android will most likely tell you that you're installing an app from unknown sources and that you have to grant permissions to do that.
4. Grand the required permissions and try installing it again, this time it will work.
5. Open up the application and have fun! 

<h2> Application Permissions </h2>

Since you're not downloading the application from Google Play Store, you may want to know what permissions does this app require and when/where they are used, so here we go.

- <b> Internet Permission </b> -> Pretty obvious, it's used to gather and parse the latest COVID-19 stats, news & data
- <b> Location Permission </b>-> Disabled by default, users can enable it if they want to use location-based stats feature, since this uses, as you may expect, GPS Localization
- <b> Networkstate Permission </b> -> Used to monitor whether the application is/isn't connected to the internet, so that it will know whether to update the stats or not

That's all.

<h2> The story behind</h2>

[Google pulled this application twice](https://i.imgur.com/odHVpRE.png) out of Google Play Store, stating that it lacks sensivity towards CoronaVirus, which is obviously not true, since all it does is showing some actual real and official data (from WHO.INT) about COVID-19.

As a result, I decided that instead of having a never-ending argue with Google Support & erasing more than 3 months of development (since I did everything by my own), I should post this application as it is here, without having to depend on Google.

The main purpose of this application was to help people have all the stats about CoronaVirus at a glance, on their android smartphones, but since Google did everything they could to stop this, I found myself with no other option than posting the application here, in hoping that the app will eventually fulfil its purpose.

This application has all the premium features activated, including an ad-free experience, so you can fully enjoy it.

<h2> Support the development </h2>

As every major step in life takes a huge ammount of time, this application was no exception to the rule.

If you enjoy it and would like me to continue adding more features, please make sure you
